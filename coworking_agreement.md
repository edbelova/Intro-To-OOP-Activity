## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*


Hsiang-ting: We are using Liveshare to discuss and share insights together.

Ekaterina Belova: I usually start by reading the README to understand the project’s purpose and requirements, then review the main code, tests etc. I like to note the requirements as comments in the functions I plan to write and clearly define the inputs and outputs first.


## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*


Hsiang-ting: Messaging on slack or having huddle as soon as possible. live share or zoom.

Ekaterina Belova: I prefer to receive feedback after I’ve finished or implemented something, rather than during the process. If there are several points to cover, I’d like to discuss them all at once. I value the chance to learn from my own mistakes, and getting feedback afterward gives me the opportunity to discover and reflect before making improvements.


## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*


Hsiang-ting: Communication of logics and solution and gain the adaptability for code style and work style with teammates.


Ekaterina Belova: I’d like to improve how I talk about and explain my code to others, including breaking down tasks and sharing them when pairing. I also want to get better at giving and receiving feedback, practice active listening to make sure everyone feels heard, and strengthen my skills in estimating time, planning sprints or tasks, and resolving disagreements constructively.


## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*


Hsiang-ting: Make a comment before changing each other's code so we can review the changes being made.


Ekaterina Belova: To be respectful of each other’s time and maintain a healthy work–life balance. We’ll give advance notice if we need to adjust our co-working schedule and be mindful of breaks so we can stay focused and productive.
